I am a PhD candidate at the Toulouse School of Economics. 

I combine <span style="color:SteelBlue">**model-based**</span> and <span style="color:SteelBlue">**design-based**</span> methods to conduct research in <span style="color:SteelBlue">**labor**</span> and <span style="color:SteelBlue">**education**</span> economics.

I will be on the 2025/2026 academic Job Market.

### Optimal Policy Design for Teacher Recruitment
(job market paper) draft coming soon

**Abstract:** This paper studies the optimal design of higher education policies targeted at improving teacher recruitment. I leverage the introduction of a policy in Chile that aimed to raise teacher quality by crowding-in higher performing students into Education programs, while crowding-out the lower-performing ones. Exploiting the sharp assignment rule, I estimate that, at the threshold, enrollment of high performing students at teacher colleges increased by 42%, and there is a shift in the distribution of test scores. Students then proceed to perform better at the labor market, with an increase in 0.11SD in Teacher Value Added and 0.12SD in a Teacher Evaluation exam. I develop a general equilibrium model of the higher education market to study the optimal design of the policy. In doing so, I present a novel method for solving discrete-continuous games in sparse markets. Counterfactual simulations show that alternative policies could have outperformed the observed one in terms of student quality, but at the cost of either (i) a higher fiscal burden or (ii) reduced market share of teacher colleges. The distribution of college quality together with capacity constraints limits the impact on teacher value added. Several mechanisms make a policy focused on low-income students to yield further gains at no additional cost.

### Effort Choices and Funding Instruments in Higher Education
(with Guillem Foucault)

**Abstract:** This paper examines the effects of Free College policies on student enrollment and academic performance, with a focus on the 2016 Chilean reform that granted tuition-free higher education to students from the lowest five income deciles. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that Free College increased enrollment and persistence in higher education but had modest effects on graduation and dropout rates. To disentangle the role of student effort from selection effects, we develop a structural model in which students choose effort levels in response to financial incentives. Our results highlight that while Free College expands access, it may also weaken performance incentives due to the removal of academic progress requirements. Counterfactual simulations suggest that alternative funding mechanisms could improve both access and academic outcomes by balancing affordability and incentives for effort.
